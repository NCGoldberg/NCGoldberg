                    I don't have full description because I started making this earlier today, so I'm just using the description from the home page. I'm currently a 
                    sophomore at Rochester Institute of Technology, majoring in Game Design & Development. I enjoy both making and playing video games, which is the 
                    main reason I decided to become a game developer.

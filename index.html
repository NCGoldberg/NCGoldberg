                    I'm currently a junior at Rochester Institute of Technology, majoring in Game Design & Development. I enjoy both making and playing video games, which is the main reason I decided to become a game developer.

                <h2>Snake 3D</h2>
                <p>
                    This is an extension of the classic game of "Snake" into the third dimension. The game is played in a first person perspective, and the player turns the snake with the arrow keys. The goal is the same as normal Snake, trying to eat as much food as possible before you die from running into your own tail or a wall. To help the player navigate the space, shadows are cast onto the walls by both the snake and the food in whatever direction the player is looking, showing where the snake is relative to the food.

                <h2>Futuristic Steve</h2>
                <p>
                    This is an endless runner game with a gravity flipping mechanic. The player controls Steve as he runs through endless obstacles, using his double jump and gravity flip to avoid hazards and collect coins. The goal is simply to get as high of a score as possible.
                    I was responsible for coding the player controller in this project, so I had to create the movement, including a double jump and the gravity flip, and also had to create collision with the terrain.
                    This game was created with C# using the MonoGame framework. As a result, pretty much everything had to be coded from scratch.
                    The game utilized a level chunk system to create the path, where small sections of terrain are stored in a file and the game randomly chooses a section to generate next. This allows each run to be different from the last, but avoids having unfair obstacles that might occur from completely random generation.
